## Demo
A HTML5 export of this project is hosted [HERE](https://crazystewie.github.io/GodotFancyLine2D/), note that performance varies from broswser to browser (on my machine it runs flawlessly on Chrome but has performance issues on Firefox, but that may changing depending on your configuration) and is overall worse than native performance.

## Credits
All textures inside [textures/](textures/) where taken from [AmbientCG](https://ambientcg.com/) and packed into the appropriate format using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
